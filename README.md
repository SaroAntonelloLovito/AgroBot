# AgroBot

AgroBot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist users with agriculture-related queries. Built using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology, AgroBot combines advanced natural language processing with a rich database of agricultural knowledge to provide accurate, context-aware, and up-to-date information to farmers, researchers, and enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Real-Time Answers**: Get instant responses to agricultural questions.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Powered by RAG technology, AgroBot retrieves relevant information from a pre-trained knowledge base and generates precise answers.
- **Wide Coverage**: Covers topics such as crop cultivation, pest management, soil health, irrigation, climate adaptation, agricultural technologies, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive to use for individuals of all technical skill levels.

## How AgroBot Works

1. **User Input**: Users ask a question related to agriculture.
2. **Retrieval**: The RAG model searches a curated database of agricultural knowledge for the most relevant information.
3. **Generation**: Using the retrieved data, AgroBot generates a detailed and user-friendly response.
4. **Response Delivery**: The answer is delivered in real-time, ensuring users can act quickly.
